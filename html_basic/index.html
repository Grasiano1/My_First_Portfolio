  <!-- Main heading -->
  <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
  <p>This is my very first webpage, built with HTML as part of my learning journey. I’m excited to explore how the web works and create something unique.</p>

  <!-- Subheading -->
  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this page is to practice HTML basics, including headings, paragraphs, and images. It may be simple, but it’s the foundation of all websites you see online.</p>

  <!-- Another subheading -->
  <h3>My Learning Goals</h3>
  <p>Through this project, I aim to build skills in front-end development and gradually move toward becoming a professional web developer. HTML is just the beginning!</p>

  <!-- Fourth paragraph -->
  <p>In the future, I will add more content, styling with CSS, and interactivity with JavaScript. For now, this page is a reminder that every expert once started as a beginner.</p>
